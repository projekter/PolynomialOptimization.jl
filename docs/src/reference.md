# Optimization reference
This reference page lists all functions that are relevant for polynomial optimization.

## Problem definition
```@docs
Problem
poly_problem(::P) where {P<:AbstractPolynomialLike}
variables
nvariables
isreal
```

## Relaxations
Types and functions related to relaxations of polynomial optimization problems are found in the submodule `Relaxation`. The
types in this module are mostly not exported, so that a qualified name is required.
```@meta
CurrentModule = PolynomialOptimization.Relaxation
```
```@docs
AbstractRelaxation
poly_problem(::AbstractRelaxation)
basis
MultivariatePolynomials.degree(::AbstractRelaxation)
groupings
iterate!(::AbstractRelaxation)

```

### Relaxations based on a global basis

### Relaxations based on individual sparsity

## Newton polytope construction (manually)
Note that using these functions is usually not necessary; construct a [`Newton`](@ref Relaxation.Newton) relaxation instead.
