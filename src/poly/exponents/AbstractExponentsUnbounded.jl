Safe version of the above. If the boolean in the result is `true`, the matrix will have at least `degree+1` rows, i.e., all
entries up to `degree` are present. If it is false, the requested degree is not present in the exponents and the matrix will
have fewer rows. Note that `true` does not mean that the degree is actually present in the exponents, only that its information
has been calculated.
