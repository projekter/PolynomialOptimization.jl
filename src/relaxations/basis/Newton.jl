        Newton(relaxation::AbstractRelaxation; [method,] parameters...)

    Constructs a relaxation based on the Newton halfpolytope applied to another relaxation of a polynomial optimization
    problem. This will be a superset of the largest possible representation for a given degree bound, with no negative
    consequences for finding the optimum. It can be much smaller than a dense basis, but solution reconstruction may be harder.

    When constraints are present, the polytope is determined based on the Putinar reformulation, where all constraints and the
    objective are moved to one side (comprising a new virtual objective). The prefactors for the constraints are determined by
    the previous relaxation method.

    Note that for the complex-valued hierarchy, strictly speaking there is no "Newton polytope"; as the representation of
    complex-valued polynomials is unique, the process is much simpler there; still, the size reduction is accomplished by using
    `Newton`.

    The `method` determines which solver to use for determining the Newton polytope. If omitted, this will be the default
    solver (in the complex case, it must be `:complex`).
    The `parameters` are passed on to [`Newton.halfpolytope`](@ref PolynomialOptimization.Newton.halfpolytope).
