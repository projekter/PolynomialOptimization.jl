# Introduction

`PolynomialOptimization` is a Julia package that allows to easily optimize large-scale polynomial optimization problems.
It builds on `MultivariatePolynomials` to provide a concise interface for the specification of the problem and allows to
directly control the problem's sparsity using correlative sparsity, (chordal) term sparsity, and a combination of both. It also
supports complex-valued problems and positive semidefinite constraints, and allows to extract solutions even for sparse
problems.
It _directly_ interfaces the solvers [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) (version 10 strongly preferred, less features available
with version 9), [COSMO](https://oxfordcontrol.github.io/COSMO.jl/stable/),
and [Hypatia](https://github.com/chriscoey/Hypatia.jl), without using `JuMP`. Despite `JuMP` being very performant for a
modelling framework, it introduces a significant overhead that is omitted in this way.


## Compatibility notice
Currently, the required complex-valued functionality is merged into `MultivariatePolynomials`, but a new release has not been
made yet. The corresponding implementation in `DynamicPolynomials` has not been merged so far. For this reason, the package is
not available on the registry at this moment. You have to manually install the necessary parts:
```
julia> ]
pkg> add MultivariatePolynomials.jl#master
pkg> add https://github.com/projekter/DynamicPolynomials.jl.git
pkg> add https://github.com/projekter/PolynomialOptimization.jl.git
```

Note that with regard to solvers, by far the most superior performance is obtained using Mosek. All features are available only
with the latest version.
